## Environment variable in Vue

To safely handle environment variables and secrets, it is good practice to add it to a `.env` file that is not committed to Git.
In Vue apps that is served using Vite, the variable name must starte with `VITE_` to be visible to the application
It can then be loaded with `import.meta.env.VITE_NAME_OF_VARIABLE`

Here is an example

```
# inside.env file

# variables prefixed with VITE_ are accessible from the vue client app
VITE_MY_ENV_VARIABLE=something

# variables without the VITE_ prefix are NOT accessible from the vue client app
SERVER_SIDE_ONLY_VAR=somethingelse
```

then we can use the environment variable as below

```
<script setup>
// something
const publicEnvVar = import.meta.env.VITE_MY_ENV_VARIABLE;
// undefined
const privateEnvVar = import.meta.env.SERVER_SIDE_ONLY_VAR;
</script>
```
